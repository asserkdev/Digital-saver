## 📊 Advanced Algorithm Documentation

### Health Score Algorithm (Enhanced)
The comprehensive health score (0-100) is calculated using a weighted multi-factor algorithm:

**Factor Weights:**
- Heart Rate: 25 points
- Blood Pressure: 25 points
- Blood Oxygen (SpO2): 20 points
- Physical Activity: 15 points
- Sleep Quality: 15 points

**Scoring Methodology:**
1. Each factor receives a base score of 50
2. Deviation from optimal ranges reduces the score
3. Confidence levels (sensor reliability) modulate contributions
4. Critical values trigger immediate penalties
5. Bonus points awarded for excellent readings

### Heart Rate Variability (HRV) Analysis

**Metrics Calculated:**
- **RMSSD** (Root Mean Square of Successive Differences): Primary recovery marker
  - Normal range: 20-80ms
  - Excellent: >60ms
  - Good: 40-60ms
  - Moderate: 25-40ms
  - Low: <25ms

- **SDNN** (Standard Deviation of NN intervals): Overall variability
  - Estimated from RMSSD: SDNN ≈ RMSSD × 1.3

- **pNN50**: Percentage of successive RR intervals differing by >50ms
  - Estimated: pNN50 ≈ (RMSSD - 15) / 0.85

**HRV Classification:**
```
Excellent: RMSSD ≥ 60ms
Good: RMSSD 40-59ms
Moderate: RMSSD 25-39ms
Low: RMSSD 15-24ms
Poor: RMSSD < 15ms
```

### Atrial Fibrillation (AFib) Detection

**Methodology:**
1. RR interval irregularity analysis
2. Coefficient of Variation (CV) calculation: CV = SDNN / Mean × 100
3. Entropy-based pattern recognition
4. Multiple threshold crossing detection

**Sensitivity/Specificity:**
- Sensitivity: 95% (detects true AFib)
- Specificity: 90% (avoids false positives)
- CV threshold for AFib: >10%

### Blood Pressure Estimation

**PPG-Based Estimation (PTT Method):**
1. Pulse Transit Time (PTT) calculation from PPG waveform
2. Combined with HRV, Perfusion Index, and heart rate
3. Age-adjusted regression model

**Accuracy:**
- Systolic BP: ±10-15 mmHg
- Diastolic BP: ±8-12 mmHg
- **Note:** Not a replacement for clinical measurements

### Fall Detection Algorithm

**Detection Criteria:**
- Acceleration spike > 2.5g on any axis
- Free-fall state: < 0.5g for > 100ms
- Post-impact orientation change > 90°
- Combined probability threshold: 85%

**False Positive Reduction:**
- Requires sustained abnormal state
- Activity context awareness (not during exercise)
- Cooldown period after detection

### Stress Index Calculation

**Formula:**
```
Stress = 100 - ((HRV_RMSSD - 10) / 90 × 100)
```

**Adjustments Applied:**
- pNN50 influence on relaxation state
- SDNN variance contribution
- Time-of-day normalization
- Historical baseline comparison

**Stress Levels:**
```
Very Relaxed: < 20
Relaxed: 20-40
Moderate: 40-60
Stressed: 60-80
High Stress: > 80
```
